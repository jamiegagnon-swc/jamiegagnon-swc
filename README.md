# Hello World!

![](avi.jpg) 

This is Jamie Gagnon (they/them), a 29 year old self-proclaimed WebMage. I am currently attending Southwestern College for my Certificate of Proficiency in Web Design. I have 20 years of hobby experience with Web Design and Development, however I would like to turn my long-time hobby into a profession. My profile Icon is a picture of my cat, Muffin (she likes to sleep under warm, soft blankets)

### Fun Facts

- I've been coding since 2003; I was 9 years old... Twitter wasn't even a thing yet!
- My first website was chock full of Sailor Moon images, and still exists on the web. (thanks freewebs)
- I made an [old meme](https://www.dictionary.com/e/memes/y-u-no/) a few years back

### About this GitHub

This account is mainly a mirror for code used on my site, [https://jamiegagnon.art](https://jamiegagnon.art) so I can show code to my professors easily, as well as keep an archive of my code after school is done and I update the site to an art/web design portfolio. :D
